# BINAUR
Binaur is a binaural beats collective meditation app built for iOS. It allows users to join and create collective meditation sessions that stimulate the user with binaural beats. Binaural beats is an audio technique to entrain brainwaves and modify states of conciousness by using to slighly different frequencies in each ear. The frequency differenence is perceived as a beat internally, that entrains brainwaves to match that frequency.

How It's Made:

Tech used: Swift, Firebase, AudioKit

The audio engine for this app was made using the AudioKit framework, which allows a very comfortable and intuitive way of mixing audio and oscillators in iOS. The collective meditation database is built on Firebase. When a user joins a session all the information from the database is loaded into the interface and audio engine. The time schedule of the sessions is displayed on whatever time zone the users device is in

Optimizations

(optional)

You don't have to include this section but interviewers love that you can not only deliver a final product that looks great but also functions efficiently. Did you write something then refactor it later and the result was 5x faster than the original implementation? Did you cache your assets? Things that you write in this section are GREAT to bring up in interviews and you can use this section as reference when studying for technical interviews!

Lessons Learned:

With this app I learned the basis of programming. It was a slow process of trial and error. In the end I learnt Swift, Firebase database management, UI design, Xcode, AudioKit and deploying an app in the App Store.
